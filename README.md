# Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence Projects
This project was conducted for a Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence course (Msc.) at ETH Zurich.

### Task 1: Gaussian Process Regression for ground-water pollution prediction
Predicts the pollution of the ground water with a Gaussian Process Regression. 

### Task 2: Predicting uncertainty with Bayesian Neural Networks on MNIST dataset
Predicts the uncertainty in handwritten digit recognition with Bayesian Neural Networks.

### Task 3: Hyperparameter tuning with constrained Bayesian optimization
Bayesian Optimization Algorithm under constraints that evaluates a domain. 

### Task 4: Actor Critic Reinforcement Learning (LunarLander-v2 OpenAI Gym)
Learn the control policy for a spaceship to land by a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm.
